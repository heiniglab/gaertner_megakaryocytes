# Code for the analyses of megakaryocyte RNA and scRNA-seq data

This repository contains all code to reproduce results of the RNA-seq and scRNA-seq analyses of megakaryocytes presented in the manuscript:


GÃ¤rtner *et al.* **Plasmacytoid dendritic cells regulate tissue homeostasis of megakaryocytes**

# Data availability
The seurat object analysed in this project are available in the Zenodo repository https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10245736

# Installation instructions
Installation Instructions Using renv.lock
This project uses renv for R package management to ensure reproducibility. Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

Install renv:

Open R or RStudio.
Run the following command to install renv:

```{R}
install.packages("renv")
```
Clone the GitHub Repository:
Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heiniglab/gaertner_megakaryocytes/
cd path-to-repo
```

Restoring the Environment:
Inside the R console (in the project directory), run the following command to restore the environment from the renv.lock file:

```{R}
renv::restore()
```
This command will install all the R packages specified in the renv.lock file.


# Tutorial
We presented our code as a R Markdown script with two HTML pages generated from the Markdown. All you need to do is download the seurat object we presented in the Zenodo repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10245736), link the location of the seurat object (final_MKP3HTO.Rds) in the script,and run the Markdown script till the end.
